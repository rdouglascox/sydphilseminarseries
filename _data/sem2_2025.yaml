  title: Transcendental Arguments
  abstract: Transcendental arguments purport to specify necessary conditions, either for our having conscious experience or our having a meaningful language.  And they have long been thought useful in addressing the most radical skeptical doubts about our knowledge of the external world.  In recent years, however, critics have questioned how any argument could take us from premises about internal mental states, appropriately conceived, to conclusions about the external world.  I argue that these doubts about transcendental arguments are misplaced.  Far from having to provide a bridge between the internal and the external as conceived by the skeptic, the proponent of a transcendental argument need only deny that any such bridge is necessary.  In their linguistically oriented forms, transcendental arguments allow us to question the capacity of the skeptic's conception of experience to ground and explain our possession of a meaningful language.  If, as I argue, a transcendental argument works, the skeptic's claim is not unanswerable but unstatable.

  title: Wittgenstein, Lugones, and the Politics of Intelligibility
  abstract: |
    One way of understanding Wittgenstein's notion of forms of life is through the Argentinian-American Lesbian philosopher Mar√≠a Lugones's notion of "worlds"--inhabited communities of sense-making. "World"-travel involves the realization that who and what one is can shift, often disconcertingly, as one moves from one to another world of sense and sees oneself reflected in different eyes. Such travel can be mandatory for those who are variously marginalized and who thereby acquire skills that the more privileged may lack, including the communal crafting of livable, intelligible identities within alternative, counter-normative "worlds". Following Wittgenstein's injunction that learning a language is learning a form of life, I want to explore responses to the linguistic innovations arising from within trans communities, such as the singular 'they' and the prefix 'cis' for non-trans women and men. As such innovations spread into the dominant "world", I will argue that we ought not to trivialize the resistance with which they are met. These shifts in "what we say" deeply challenge and change the dominant world of sense, undermining a form of life in which there are, for example, only two genders and which one we are is determined by how we are assigned at birth. Such a shift (one I think we have conclusive reason to undertake) is and ought to be seriously disconcerting.
