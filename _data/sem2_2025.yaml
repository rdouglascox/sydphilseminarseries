  title: Transcendental Arguments
  abstract: Transcendental arguments purport to specify necessary conditions, either for our having conscious experience or our having a meaningful language.  And they have long been thought useful in addressing the most radical skeptical doubts about our knowledge of the external world.  In recent years, however, critics have questioned how any argument could take us from premises about internal mental states, appropriately conceived, to conclusions about the external world.  I argue that these doubts about transcendental arguments are misplaced.  Far from having to provide a bridge between the internal and the external as conceived by the skeptic, the proponent of a transcendental argument need only deny that any such bridge is necessary.  In their linguistically oriented forms, transcendental arguments allow us to question the capacity of the skeptic's conception of experience to ground and explain our possession of a meaningful language.  If, as I argue, a transcendental argument works, the skeptic's claim is not unanswerable but unstatable.

  title: Wittgenstein, Lugones, and the Politics of Intelligibility
  abstract: |
    One way of understanding Wittgenstein's notion of forms of life is through the Argentinian-American Lesbian philosopher María Lugones's notion of "worlds"--inhabited communities of sense-making. "World"-travel involves the realization that who and what one is can shift, often disconcertingly, as one moves from one to another world of sense and sees oneself reflected in different eyes. Such travel can be mandatory for those who are variously marginalized and who thereby acquire skills that the more privileged may lack, including the communal crafting of livable, intelligible identities within alternative, counter-normative "worlds". Following Wittgenstein's injunction that learning a language is learning a form of life, I want to explore responses to the linguistic innovations arising from within trans communities, such as the singular 'they' and the prefix 'cis' for non-trans women and men. As such innovations spread into the dominant "world", I will argue that we ought not to trivialize the resistance with which they are met. These shifts in "what we say" deeply challenge and change the dominant world of sense, undermining a form of life in which there are, for example, only two genders and which one we are is determined by how we are assigned at birth. Such a shift (one I think we have conclusive reason to undertake) is and ought to be seriously disconcerting.

  title: Early Confucianism and Knowledge-to
  abstract: | 
    I argue that early Confucian philosophical texts offer us a view on which a person’s knowing to φ---that is, her *knowledge-to*---is a distinct kind of knowledge irreducible to more familiar kinds, such as knowing-that, knowing-how, or knowing-by-acquaintance. Unlike knowing-that, knowing-to is non-propositional, and unlike knowing-how and knowing-by-acquaintance, knowing-to is present only when the agent is performing a corresponding action. I defend such an early Confucian account of knowledge-to by arguing that it offers us an attractive conceptual alternative to standard ways of thinking about the relation between knowledge and action.

    Depopulation: an ethical perspective
  abstract: |
    Two-thirds of humanity now live in states where fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman (Madgavkar et al. 2025, 3). Even states with high standards of living, where one would expect citizens to be optimistic about the prospects of their children such as France, Australia, and Japan have found themselves with fewer than two children per woman—with France at 1.9, Australia at 1.5, and Japan at 1.4. With current trends, some countries could see their populations shrink by up to 50% by the turn of the century (Ibid). How should liberal states respond, given that these changes will significantly disrupt retirement systems and government services like healthcare and aged care? In this talk, I will explore the ethical complexities around potential solutions like boosting fertility, delaying retirement, improving productivity, and increasing skilled migration.

  title: Maintaining an ethical asymmetry between conserving and creating biodiversity
  abstract: | 
    Environmental conservation as a practice and philosophy has been implicitly and explicitly backward-looking. It is the act of preserving, conserving, restoring, and maintaining the features of the biotic world we inherit. Increasingly, this bias has been confronted by anthropogenic environmental change and increasing capacity to address existential environmental risk with technology. There has been a call to re-evaluate and support the practice of creating novel ecological arrangements (novel ecosystems) and to incorporate the value of engineered biotic novelty (novel biodiversity). This paper confronts the question of what, in principle, could justify a bias in value towards preserving biodiversity over creating biodiversity. I present two related, but ultimately independent, arguments for this position. First, I will consider methodological reasons towards preserving environmental value from axiology. There are a range of reasons that value conserved has been considered preferable to value created, beyond an unguided dispositional status quo bias (Cohen 2011; Brennan & Hamlin 2016). I argue the processes and products of deep history instantiate features that warrant asymmetrical valuation. Second, I present a reconsidered version of ‘authenticity’ as a justification for preserving biodiversity (Katz 2022). Under my presentation, authenticity refers to the evolved entanglement and interdependency of lineages and gene lineages. These interdependencies should be valued epistemologically and aesthetically.

  title: Murdoch on Moral Activity and the Gospels as Art
  abstract: |
    This paper examines two theses from the philosophy of Iris Murdoch.  The first is her view (developed especially in *The Sovereignty of Good*) that moral activity is centrally a matter of *love*, conceived as infinitely perfectible “knowledge of the individual”.  What is philosophically distinctive in her thesis, I suggest, turns on her conception of the singularity of the activity itself — that it can only ever be done “alone and differently” (61).  The second is Murdoch’s claim that “art is … a case of morals” with respect to the discipline of attention, or love, that it properly involves (58).  These ideas remain difficult and provocative, despite their role in reshaping ethics in what have become familiar, even mainstream, ways.  I re-examine them in light of Murdoch’s avowed debt to “the Christian ethic, whose centre is an individual” (28).  The Gospels narrate the life of Jesus, an individual who loved individuals: so do the Gospels present moral activity as Murdoch understands this – and if so, how?  I suggest that the answer is tied to the question of whether we can read them as art.  I draw on Murdoch’s conception of moral activity to consider the aesthetically and theologically delicate status of the Gospels as art.  I conclude by looking more closely at the representation of love in the Gospels as a way to bring to light what might justify Murdoch’s placement of love at the centre of human goodness.

  title: Feasibility Beyond ‘Ought’ Implies ‘Can’
  abstract: |
    Many of us are tempted by the idea that there is a Feasibility Requirement on the correctness or validity of certain normative claims about politics: claims about the laws and policies states ought to implement, the obligations we have regarding the organisation of social and political life, the institutional arrangements that justice requires us to bring about, and so on. But how exactly should we interpret this idea of a Feasibility Requirement? The standard interpretation treats it as a particular instance of the principle that “Ought” Implies “Can.” I argue that this is a mistake. The problem with the standard interpretation is that it cannot make sense of certain central feasibility-involving inferences. I propose a non-standard interpretation according to which the Feasibility Requirement is instead a specific instance of a stronger principle that I call the Feasible Demands Thesis. This holds that claims about what we ought to do, in order to be correct or valid, must not make infeasible explicit or implicit demands. Interpreting the Feasibility Requirement in terms of the Feasible Demands Thesis helps to undermine the primary motivation for embracing a kind of Revisionary Realism, according to which feasibility’s primary normative significance is not adequately captured by the idea of a Feasibility Requirement. We do not need to go beyond a Feasibility Requirement so long as it is correctly interpreted, or so I argue.

    On Referring: The Beginning
  abstract: | 
    When does referential behavior emerge in ontogeny and phylogeny? The standard answer is that referring requires language. A different answer is that referring already appears in non-human animal communication. I argue that referential behavior is uniquely human but that it emerges prior to the development of language, both in ontogeny and in phylogeny.
    In this talk, I examine the strongest candidates for non-human referential behavior, drawing partly on existing literature and partly on novel cases. I discuss behaviors such as beckoning, honeyguide interactions, begging, and even pointing among non-human primates, in comparison with human pointing behavior. I compare human and non-human primate pointing and elaborate on the relevant differences (Leavens 2004). To clarify these differences, I propose to compare begging, showing, and pointing gestures. Non-human primates readily understand begging and showing gestures, such as lifting an object to display it (e.g., Grice’s example of presenting St. John’s head on a plate). However, pointing is cognitively and communicatively more complex. Research suggests that showing emerges earlier than pointing in human development (Ruether & Liszkowski 2024), reinforcing the idea that pointing requires distinct cognitive and social abilities that only develop later. I explain the advantages of pointing over showing or simply looking when used for referring—behaviors already displayed by chimpanzees and bonobos.
    In this discussion, I use pointing to encompass not only Referential Pointing but also to other forms of non-referential pointing that serve different communicative or cognitive functions. When pointing is discussed in the philosophy of language (Kaplan 1978; Stojnić et al. 2013; Dickie 2015), it is usually restricted to pointing that fixes or shows the referent of a demonstrative expression such as this or that. I argue, however, that there are multiple forms of pointing, and this is only one among them. Most discussions—including those by Augustine, Wittgenstein, Kaplan, and Stojnić—focus only on a special use of pointing, such as pointing in language acquisition or for demonstratives, yet their general claims are often treated as if they are applicable to pointing in general.
    I argue that infants between 9 and 15 months of age already demonstrate referential behavior through their use of referential pointing (Tomasello et al. 2007; Liszkowski & Tomasello 2011; Carpenter et al. 1998; Liszkowski et al. 2007; Tomasello 2010; Leavens et al. 1996; Shatz & O’Reilly 1990; Leavens et al. 2005; Shwe & Markman 1997; Orbán 2025). By this stage, infants are capable of employing pointing gestures to express themselves. In the literature, referential pointing is often treated merely as proto-referential behavior rather than as genuine referring, or else referring itself is treated as exclusively linguistic behavior (cf. Davidson 1977, 1979; Bates et al. 1975; Strawson 1959). Referential pointing, in particular, involves joint attention to indicate a referent, either declaratively (e.g., “This is interesting”) or imperatively (e.g., “Give me that”). An incorrect response typically prompts corrective behavior from the signaller until the intended action occurs. I employ several strategies to argue that referential pointing qualifies as genuine referring, including showing that it passes the standard tests for reference.

    Assessing the Bayesian picture of scientific advice: On the political division of labour. (Joint work with Ahmad Elabbar (HPS, University of Cambridge))
  abstract: |
    Richard Jeffrey (1956) famously articulated an internal critique to Richard Rudner’s (1953) argument from inductive risk and offered an alternative view of scientific advice, which we call “the Bayesian picture of scientific advice” (BPSA). It involves two essential commitments: scientists should communicate their subjective probabilities (vs. outright beliefs) in hypotheses and doing so upholds a political division of labour (i.e., scientists bring the epistemic input; policy-makers bring the evaluative judgments).
    We argue that communicating credences doesn’t deliver the division of labour—the idea that such a prize is secured by the Bayesian picture is an artifact of the idealizations behind the debate around the inductive risk debate. Basically: scientists’ role in policy advice goes well beyond reporting credences (or outright beliefs for that matter) for a hypotheses previously specified by policy makers. Scientists are necessarily involved in the framing of policy (decision) problems, i.e., in the curation of the policy actions, the states-of-nature, and outcomes that are worth considering. (They are even needed to come up with utility numbers!) And these tasks cannot be done without making value-judgments. This is easy to see when looking at well-studied cases of scientific advice such as large-scale environmental assessments—we focus on the IPCC reports in the talk—but the point generalizes.
