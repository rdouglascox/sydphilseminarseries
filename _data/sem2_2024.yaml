  title: "A natural argument for contextualism"
  abstract: "In the debate between contextualist and moderate invariantist theories of knowledge, linguistic data have been the primary focus. In this paper, however, I come at the debate from a very different angle: I argue that contextualism is a much more natural theory – it is much better at respecting the objective metaphysical structure of reality – than moderate invariantism. From this, I draw two further conclusions: first, that contextualism is, in one important respect, much more charitable than moderate invariantism; second, that even if moderate invariantism is true, we should replace our invariantist concept of knowledge with its contextualist analog."

  title: Why isn’t (purely) epistemic autonomy of value?
  abstract: "In the practical domain, there are some decisions such that it’s more important that the agent make them herself than that they make the best decision. (Think, for instance, about choosing a romantic partner). In such cases, it seems like a rational agent may insist on making the decision themselves, fully recognizing that if they let someone else decide for them, the decision may be (otherwise) better. In the epistemic case, though, there doesn’t seem to be an analogue of this phenomenon. If I wonder whether p; it seems to me when I consider the first-order evidence that p; but I recognize that my chances of getting to a true belief regarding p are much higher if I rely on you instead; and you say that not-p – well, in such a case it seems a belief in p is never epistemically justified. This paper is my (tentative, and not systematic) attempt to think through this disanalogy between the role of autonomy in the epistemic and practical domain."

  title: Feminism Beyond Left and Right
  abstract: "Target claim: feminists should not work with the right. This claim has multiple moving parts (‘feminists’, ‘the right’) and involves a moral imperative, to do with working together with others, that is not been particularly well-theorised. I’ll offer a definition of feminism that should be acceptable to many different types of feminists; assess the question of whether ‘the right’ can be given any meaningful content; and draw on some recent philosophical work that can be adapted to answer ethical questions about working together with others in pursuit of shared political ends. I’ll argue that only if we collapse the moral/political distinction and conflate left/right with good/bad can we get any traction on the idea that feminists should not work with the right."
