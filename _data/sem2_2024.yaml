  title: "A natural argument for contextualism"
  abstract: "In the debate between contextualist and moderate invariantist theories of knowledge, linguistic data have been the primary focus. In this paper, however, I come at the debate from a very different angle: I argue that contextualism is a much more natural theory – it is much better at respecting the objective metaphysical structure of reality – than moderate invariantism. From this, I draw two further conclusions: first, that contextualism is, in one important respect, much more charitable than moderate invariantism; second, that even if moderate invariantism is true, we should replace our invariantist concept of knowledge with its contextualist analog."

  title: Resentment and Repair
  abstract: "Sometimes when we forgive someone who has hurt us, it is because we have good reasons to change our outlook on the wrongdoer. Perhaps the person who wronged us offered a sincere apology, they found a way to make amends or, we have decided, they have suffered enough. The person who wronged us has done something to make things right. Other times, when we forgive someone, it feels more like a gift, something we offer freely, without judging that the wrongdoer has earned it. Maybe we are tired of being burdened by our anger, or we believe in unconditional love and kindness, or we have simply ceased to care about the offense. In this paper,  I articulate one way that we give up our resentment against someone who has hurt us that does not fit either of these models. The argument will have consequences for thinking about when we ought to forgive, and more generally, for thinking about the limits of Strawson’s participant stance as it has been traditionally conceived.

  title: Why isn’t (purely) epistemic autonomy of value?
  abstract: "In the practical domain, there are some decisions such that it’s more important that the agent make them herself than that they make the best decision. (Think, for instance, about choosing a romantic partner). In such cases, it seems like a rational agent may insist on making the decision themselves, fully recognizing that if they let someone else decide for them, the decision may be (otherwise) better. In the epistemic case, though, there doesn’t seem to be an analogue of this phenomenon. If I wonder whether p; it seems to me when I consider the first-order evidence that p; but I recognize that my chances of getting to a true belief regarding p are much higher if I rely on you instead; and you say that not-p – well, in such a case it seems a belief in p is never epistemically justified. This paper is my (tentative, and not systematic) attempt to think through this disanalogy between the role of autonomy in the epistemic and practical domain."

  title: "Parental Partiality in Unjust Circumstances: Inheritance as Insurance"
  abstract: "There is broad egalitarian agreement that, in existing societies, inheritance results in distributive injustice and indirectly delegitimises the political process. I assume that we should abolish it and fund, amongst other justice-promoting policies, an adequate and robust safety net. But, I argue, in societies that lack such safety nets parents do no wrong in bequeathing to their children and indeed have weighty moral reason to do so. In such societies, both procreative liability and parental love justify some bequest as insurance against poverty. The justified bequests, while limited both in size and form, may be very substantial in aggregate, and therefore impede egalitarian reforms. I conclude that procreative liability and parental love provide (would-be) parents with special – and powerful – reasons to support adequate public safety nets."

  title: Feminism Beyond Left and Right
  abstract: "Target claim: feminists should not work with the right. This claim has multiple moving parts (‘feminists’, ‘the right’) and involves a moral imperative, to do with working together with others, that is not been particularly well-theorised. I’ll offer a definition of feminism that should be acceptable to many different types of feminists; assess the question of whether ‘the right’ can be given any meaningful content; and draw on some recent philosophical work that can be adapted to answer ethical questions about working together with others in pursuit of shared political ends. I’ll argue that only if we collapse the moral/political distinction and conflate left/right with good/bad can we get any traction on the idea that feminists should not work with the right."

  title: The Risky Business of Forgiveness
  abstract: "Philosophers have noted a tension between two independently plausible features of forgiveness: (1) Forgiveness is reasoned: it is something that agents do for reasons, and (2) Forgiveness is elective: it is not something that agents can be required to do. As Per-Erik Milam (2018) has recently argued, if something is done for reasons, particularly moral reasons, then those reasons can, at least sometimes, generate a requirement for an agent to do that thing. So, those who wish to defend both (1) and (2) must deny that reasons to forgive can be requiring and explain why these reasons possess this potentially unique feature. In this talk, I take up this challenge. I argue that forgiveness is reasoned and elective because it is risky. By reflecting on the riskiness of forgiveness, we can come to see not only how forgiveness can be both reasoned and elective, but also why forgiveness is not so unlike other attitudes at play in our moral lives."

  title: "Atheist Debunkers and Otherworld Calvinism"
  abstract: "In the philosophy of religion, 'de jure objections' is an umbrella term that is used to cover a range of arguments for the conclusion that theistic belief is irrational or unreasonable, either if God does or does not exist. Such arguments can be found in the work of Hume, Kant, Russell, and more recently, Oppy and evolutionary debunkers like Dennett, Wilkins, and Griffiths. It has also been argued that Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche offered similar critiques. What we call ‘otherworld Calvinism’ counters these objections by proposing the counterfactual conditional that ‘if God exists, God would ensure theistic belief’s reasonableness’. We respond to this otherworld Calvinist argument by examining it through the lenses of probability, modality, and logic. After examining various forms of the argument, we argue that none of them can compel sophisticated atheist thinkers to believe that serious theistic possibilities worth considering, from their perspective, would involve such a divine measure."

  title: No convergence on longtermism
  abstract: "Abstract: Longtermists prioritize the far future. They think that when we donate to relieve suffering, we should only donate to longtermist charities that lower existential risk – the risk that humanity is wiped out, or locked into an oppressive equilibrium. For instance, we should donate to deflecting asteroids, or making AI safe, or something similar - some of Sam Bankman-Fried’s priorities. Donating to relieve present suffering is wrong. Longtermists argue that all defensible moral theories converge on longtermism. The only way to avoid longtermism, they argue, is to discount future people in a way that’s morally indefensible. This talk shows how one kind of moral theory is incompatible with longtermism. I then generalize: I suggest that contractualism and certain kinds of Kantianism would be incompatible with longtermism for closely related reasons."

  title: "Why We Should Only Be Quasi-Expressivists"
  abstract: "Quasi-expressivism assigns to conversational pragmatics those features of discourse that expressivism-proper essentially assigns to meaning. Building on others' work, I argue that there are compelling reasons to think that the Frege-Geach problem for expressivism is irresolvable. Expressivists can opt for a single- or a dual-attitude strategy. It's now recognized that single-attitude strategies are committed to an explosion of attitude-types, an implication some thinkers have begun to embrace. I'll object not to the number, but to the types of some of these required attitudes. Whereas dual-attitude strategies escape the Frege-Geach problems, my objection is that they accomplish this only by abandoning central expressivist motivations."

  title: Quantum location is not indeterminate location
  abstract: "It has been argued that quantum mechanics provides the best case for thinking there is genuine metaphysical indeterminacy. In particular, it seems that the locations of quantum systems are indeterminate in a way that doesn’t depend on our representational or epistemic limitations. In this paper, I draw on concepts from the metaphysics of location to dispel this impression. Using quantum versions of exact and weak location I distinguish two accounts of quantum location: the spanner view and the inexact location view. Each account requires the rejection of an intuitive locative principle, but I argue that neither gives rise to metaphysical indeterminacy."

  title: Phronesis and Techne in Aristotle’s Theory of Intellectual Virtue
  abstract: "In this talk I consider two questions about Aristotle’s theory of intellectual virtue, as presented in Book 6 of the Nicomachean Ethics (= Book 5 of the Eudemian Ethics). First, what is intellectual virtue? Second, which capacities are intellectual virtues? With regard to the first question, I propose a generic definition of intellectual virtue in terms of excellence in attaining truth. I also propose two specific definitions corresponding to the two species of intellectual virtue that Aristotle recognises: theoretical and practical. In the second part of the talk I focus on practical intellectual virtue. I argue that Aristotle holds that there is exactly one such virtue—namely, phronesis (practical wisdom)—and that techne (craft, art) is not an intellectual virtue. I consider the reasons why Aristotle denies that techne is an intellectual virtue, focusing on the different roles that phronesis and techne play in practical reasoning or deliberation."

  title: "The Explanatory Emptiness of Conciliatory Expressivism"
  abstract: 'Expressivism is a prominent kind of metaethical view. Put roughly, according to metaethical expressivism, ethical judgments consist in desire-like mental states, rather than belief-like ones, which people then express when making ethical statements. Proponents of metaethical expressivism often claim that an important comparative advantage of their view is that if can avoid central metaphysical and epistemological challenges that more "realist" metaethical views face. Two important (purported) examples of such problems are 1) explaining the supervenience of the ethical on the natural and 2) explaining our reliability in key parts of ethical judgment. We challenge this understanding. In order to have a form of expressivism that captures key parts of how people actually think and talk, there is significant pressure for expressivists to advance "conciliatory" or "accommodationist" versions of their view. Put roughly, such versions of expressivism – which are the most common kinds of expressivist views in contemporary metaethics – involve taking on board theses about the nature of "beliefs", "truths", and \“facts\” that allow expressivists to say that, in at least one important "deflationary" sense there is a way in which ethical thought does involve truth-apt "ethical beliefs" about "ethical facts". However, this move leads to a problem. In short, conciliatory expressivism provides the expressive resources to allow us to felicitously express many of the core metaphysical and epistemological explanatory challenges (e.g., the challenges involving supervenience and reliability) that matter for more straightforwardly "realist" metaethical theories (especially "non-naturalist" ones). Moreover, conciliatory expressivism does not provide any distinctive resources for addressing these challenges. If it can "answer" the challenges, it is not because of the view itself, but rather because of optional "add-on" commitments, which are also equally available in combination with other metaethical views. This result has important implications for how we think about the overall prospects of expressivism in metaethics, as well as in other areas of philosophy where it has gained traction in recent years (such as in normative epistemology and in discussions about modality).'

  title: 'The Responsiveness of Nature. A Phenomenological Approach to the Responsibility for the “More-Than-Human-Nature”'
  abstract: 'The concept of responsibility is inherently responsive and relational. It places us in a moral demand before the other, to whom we are morally obliged to respond. In responding to the other, we do so in two ways: firstly, through the act of "living with" and "being with" the other; and secondly, through a moral reflection on what we ought to do. This presentation argues that it is from the responsive encounter with the "more-than-human" other that the imperative of responsibility arises for the flourishing of the common good of all living beings. The following questions are therefore addressed: How can we listen to the more-than-human world and enable its participation? How can we interact? The approach will be phenomenological, with the argument being made that the "being with the other" is a pre-existing condition. Even before we are aware of it, we are immersed in the phenomenon of life. This phenomenon of life encompasses the "more-than-human" world and, as the presentation argues, also gives rise to a moral obligation. As human beings, we are bound to the "more-than-human" other, and thus called to listen to and respond with appropriate responsibility. The presentation falls in three parts. In the first part we turn to relatively recent philosophical approaches regarding the relation between responsiveness and responsibility. The second section turns to the Danish philosopher and theologian, K.E. Løgstrup, for his understanding of the senses in relation to the universe as he calls it. The third part returns to the question of responsiveness with the aim to argue for the link between responsiveness and responsibility and to argue that this entails a call for responsibility to the “more-than-human-nature”.'

  title: 'Platform Tyranny, Rule of Law, and Virtual Community'
  abstract: 'Political philosophers have long been concerned with how to avoid state tyranny, the condition of governments having arbitrary power over citizens. A standard response is that avoiding tyranny requires making power holders conform to rule of law principles, for instance by considering their power legitimate only when used according to rules that are public, fairly enforced, and meaningfully contestable. Political scientists, economists, and journalists meanwhile often claim online platforms are sites of tyranny because of the arbitrary power platform owners have over platform users. This raises the question: When are state and platform tyranny sufficiently similar that platforms must conform to rule of law principles to govern users legitimately? I argue the analogy can hold for virtual communities. Given the role some virtual communities play in meeting their members\' vital interests, platforms must govern these communities according to rule of law principles to be legitimate.'
