  title: "A natural argument for contextualism"
  abstract: "In the debate between contextualist and moderate invariantist theories of knowledge, linguistic data have been the primary focus. In this paper, however, I come at the debate from a very different angle: I argue that contextualism is a much more natural theory – it is much better at respecting the objective metaphysical structure of reality – than moderate invariantism. From this, I draw two further conclusions: first, that contextualism is, in one important respect, much more charitable than moderate invariantism; second, that even if moderate invariantism is true, we should replace our invariantist concept of knowledge with its contextualist analog."
