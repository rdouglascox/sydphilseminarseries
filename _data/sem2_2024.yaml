  title: "A natural argument for contextualism"
  abstract: "In the debate between contextualist and moderate invariantist theories of knowledge, linguistic data have been the primary focus. In this paper, however, I come at the debate from a very different angle: I argue that contextualism is a much more natural theory – it is much better at respecting the objective metaphysical structure of reality – than moderate invariantism. From this, I draw two further conclusions: first, that contextualism is, in one important respect, much more charitable than moderate invariantism; second, that even if moderate invariantism is true, we should replace our invariantist concept of knowledge with its contextualist analog."

  title: Resentment and Repair
  abstract: "Sometimes when we forgive someone who has hurt us, it is because we have good reasons to change our outlook on the wrongdoer. Perhaps the person who wronged us offered a sincere apology, they found a way to make amends or, we have decided, they have suffered enough. The person who wronged us has done something to make things right. Other times, when we forgive someone, it feels more like a gift, something we offer freely, without judging that the wrongdoer has earned it. Maybe we are tired of being burdened by our anger, or we believe in unconditional love and kindness, or we have simply ceased to care about the offense. In this paper,  I articulate one way that we give up our resentment against someone who has hurt us that does not fit either of these models. The argument will have consequences for thinking about when we ought to forgive, and more generally, for thinking about the limits of Strawson’s participant stance as it has been traditionally conceived.

  title: Why isn’t (purely) epistemic autonomy of value?
  abstract: "In the practical domain, there are some decisions such that it’s more important that the agent make them herself than that they make the best decision. (Think, for instance, about choosing a romantic partner). In such cases, it seems like a rational agent may insist on making the decision themselves, fully recognizing that if they let someone else decide for them, the decision may be (otherwise) better. In the epistemic case, though, there doesn’t seem to be an analogue of this phenomenon. If I wonder whether p; it seems to me when I consider the first-order evidence that p; but I recognize that my chances of getting to a true belief regarding p are much higher if I rely on you instead; and you say that not-p – well, in such a case it seems a belief in p is never epistemically justified. This paper is my (tentative, and not systematic) attempt to think through this disanalogy between the role of autonomy in the epistemic and practical domain."

  title: "Parental Partiality in Unjust Circumstances: Inheritance as Insurance"
  abstract: "There is broad egalitarian agreement that, in existing societies, inheritance results in distributive injustice and indirectly delegitimises the political process. I assume that we should abolish it and fund, amongst other justice-promoting policies, an adequate and robust safety net. But, I argue, in societies that lack such safety nets parents do no wrong in bequeathing to their children and indeed have weighty moral reason to do so. In such societies, both procreative liability and parental love justify some bequest as insurance against poverty. The justified bequests, while limited both in size and form, may be very substantial in aggregate, and therefore impede egalitarian reforms. I conclude that procreative liability and parental love provide (would-be) parents with special – and powerful – reasons to support adequate public safety nets."

  title: Feminism Beyond Left and Right
  abstract: "Target claim: feminists should not work with the right. This claim has multiple moving parts (‘feminists’, ‘the right’) and involves a moral imperative, to do with working together with others, that is not been particularly well-theorised. I’ll offer a definition of feminism that should be acceptable to many different types of feminists; assess the question of whether ‘the right’ can be given any meaningful content; and draw on some recent philosophical work that can be adapted to answer ethical questions about working together with others in pursuit of shared political ends. I’ll argue that only if we collapse the moral/political distinction and conflate left/right with good/bad can we get any traction on the idea that feminists should not work with the right."

  title: The Risky Business of Forgiveness
  abstract: "Philosophers have noted a tension between two independently plausible features of forgiveness: (1) Forgiveness is reasoned: it is something that agents do for reasons, and (2) Forgiveness is elective: it is not something that agents can be required to do. As Per-Erik Milam (2018) has recently argued, if something is done for reasons, particularly moral reasons, then those reasons can, at least sometimes, generate a requirement for an agent to do that thing. So, those who wish to defend both (1) and (2) must deny that reasons to forgive can be requiring and explain why these reasons possess this potentially unique feature. In this talk, I take up this challenge. I argue that forgiveness is reasoned and elective because it is risky. By reflecting on the riskiness of forgiveness, we can come to see not only how forgiveness can be both reasoned and elective, but also why forgiveness is not so unlike other attitudes at play in our moral lives."

  title: "Atheist Debunkers and Otherworld Calvinism"
  abstract: "In the philosophy of religion, 'de jure objections' is an umbrella term that is used to cover a range of arguments for the conclusion that theistic belief is irrational or unreasonable, either if God does or does not exist. Such arguments can be found in the work of Hume, Kant, Russell, and more recently, Oppy and evolutionary debunkers like Dennett, Wilkins, and Griffiths. It has also been argued that Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche offered similar critiques. What we call ‘otherworld Calvinism’ counters these objections by proposing the counterfactual conditional that ‘if God exists, God would ensure theistic belief’s reasonableness’. We respond to this otherworld Calvinist argument by examining it through the lenses of probability, modality, and logic. After examining various forms of the argument, we argue that none of them can compel sophisticated atheist thinkers to believe that serious theistic possibilities worth considering, from their perspective, would involve such a divine measure."

  title: No convergence on longtermism
  abstract: "Abstract: Longtermists prioritize the far future. They think that when we donate to relieve suffering, we should only donate to longtermist charities that lower existential risk – the risk that humanity is wiped out, or locked into an oppressive equilibrium. For instance, we should donate to deflecting asteroids, or making AI safe, or something similar - some of Sam Bankman-Fried’s priorities. Donating to relieve present suffering is wrong. Longtermists argue that all defensible moral theories converge on longtermism. The only way to avoid longtermism, they argue, is to discount future people in a way that’s morally indefensible. This talk shows how one kind of moral theory is incompatible with longtermism. I then generalize: I suggest that contractualism and certain kinds of Kantianism would be incompatible with longtermism for closely related reasons."

  title: "Why We Should Only Be Quasi-Expressivists"
  abstract: "Quasi-expressivism assigns to conversational pragmatics those features of discourse that expressivism-proper essentially assigns to meaning. Building on others' work, I argue that there are compelling reasons to think that the Frege-Geach problem for expressivism is irresolvable. Expressivists can opt for a single- or a dual-attitude strategy. It's now recognized that single-attitude strategies are committed to an explosion of attitude-types, an implication some thinkers have begun to embrace. I'll object not to the number, but to the types of some of these required attitudes. Whereas dual-attitude strategies escape the Frege-Geach problems, my objection is that they accomplish this only by abandoning central expressivist motivations."
