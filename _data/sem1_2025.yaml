  title: What is Interesting about Conspiracy Theories?
  abstract: | 
    A central debate in conspiracy theory research concerns how to conceptualize conspiracy theories in a way that advances our understanding of the phenomena and those who believe in them. This debate remains unresolved, with researchers adopting widely different positions: while some argue for a purely descriptive understanding, others seem strongly committed to the view that conspiracy theories are, or can be shown to be, inherently irrational. This paper reconstructs the controversy, arguing that it stems from two distinct scholarly motives: to attain objective knowledge of the phenomena in question versus to defend beliefs and norms that are part of the researcher’s own cultural context. By examining the epistemological and methodological challenges in this field, I highlight how competing frameworks—normative cultural biases versus objective scientific inquiry—shape our understanding of rational belief. When cultural biases influence research, they risk narrowing its scope and undermining the development of a comprehensive understanding of conspiracy theories. Ultimately, even proponents of normative cultural approaches can acknowledge that such perspectives fail to capture the full complexity and significance of these phenomena

  title: Representations, Models, and Proofs/Rules
  abstract: |
    In this paper I present and assess, firstly independently from one another, and then comparatively, the strengths and the weaknesses of three views on semantics: model-theoretic, truth-conditional, and proof-theoretic. The whole philosophical perspective from which I explore those three approaches is motivated by the investigation of the connection between truth and meaning, and also by the understanding of the role and place of meaning within a physicalist outlook of the world. I also hint at how one can combine and coordinate those three approaches depending on the philosophical issues which those systems seek to model. In the process, I present the philosophical rich and nuanced positions of Donald Davidson who pioneered the Tarski-type truth-conditional semantics for natural languages, and of Wilfrid Sellars who made an essential contribution to the understanding of both semantic and pragmatic aspects of the relations between truth and meaning from an inferentialist (proof) based perspective. The paper sketches how certain problems within the Davidsonian framework can be fixed within the Sellarsian framework. The paper ends with some critical points and challenges that I raise against the proof-theoretic (inferentialist) approach questioning its power to give a complete account of the issue of the relationship between truth, meanings, and rules.

  title: Recognizing artificial mathematical intelligence in theorem proving
  abstract: |
    One key question in the philosophy of artificial intelligence (AI) concerns how we can recognize artificial systems as intelligent. To make the general question more manageable, I focus on a particular type of AI, namely one that can prove mathematical theorems. The current generation of automated theorem provers are not understood to possess intelligence, but in my thought experiment an AI provides humanly interesting proofs of theorems and communicates them in human-like manner as scientific papers. I then ask what the criteria could be for recognizing such an AI as intelligent. I propose an approach in which the relevant criteria are based on the AI’s interaction within the mathematical community. Finally, I ask whether we can deny the intelligence of the AI in such a scenario based on reasons other than its (non-biological) material construction.

  title: Tolerance, Autonomy, and Free Expression
  abstract: |
    Problems surrounding “toleration of the intolerant” are addressed by Ben Kerr and I with a hierarchical framework that explicitly distinguishes levels of tolerance and intolerance. This talk will look at the application of the framework to free expression. The “Voltairean principle” formulated by Evelyn Beatrice Hall – "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it” – illustrates the themes. With the framework in place, I'll look at arguments bearing on tolerance of the expression of controversial opinions, making use of Tim Scanlon’s 1972 paper “A Theory of Freedom of Expression.”

    A Dose of Medicine in Sextus Empiricus' Philosophy
  abstract: | 
    Sextus Empiricus was a doctor, a member of the Empiric school, as well as a skeptical philosopher. There are clear links between Empiricist medicine and his brand of skepticism. The use of medical analogies in Greek philosophy goes back at least to Plato. But how far does Sextus appeal to medical analogies in explaining his own philosophy? The answer is, less than we might have expected, even though he often uses examples from medicine. But perhaps he took the general analogy between skepticism and medicine for granted. It is also worth asking how far viewing his skeptical method in light of the medical analogy is helpful for us in understanding him. Here too, there may be limits to how illuminating this is; however, there are certainly connections worth exploring.

  title: Rights, Powers, and Paternalism
  abstract: | 
    It is controversial when we are morally permitted to act for another’s good. Some suggest that we are rarely permitted to do so given that competent adults have a pro tanto claim right to be the only ones to act only or primarily for their own good. Others suggest that people have a special moral power over their good – what has been called the power of prudential exclusion (PPE) – such that they can exclude us from acting for their good when it would otherwise be permissible for us to do so. I have three aims in this paper. The first is to argue that, rather than the aforementioned right, competent adults more plausibly have a pro tanto claim right against others acting to promote their good for a particular set of well-being-related second-order reasons. Specifically, according to this right, others must not promote their good for the reason that (a) they are unlikely to (or will not) deliberate, judge, or act in their best interests and/or that (b) their judgment or decision about what is valuable or in their best interests is mistaken and/or inferior to the acting agent’s. The second is to introduce a corollary power to the PPE – what I call the power of prudential inclusion (PPI) – which holds that we have the moral power to give others permission to act for our good when it would otherwise be impermissible for them to do so. The third is to sketch a novel rights-based anti-paternalist account based on the right that I (partly) defend we have.

  title: Educational Justice as Fairness 
  abstract: | 
    Most, if not all, systems of education in advanced industrial societies fail to give all participants within them a fair chance. They are, in this respect, unfair. What makes them unfair? And what would it take to give all participants a fair chance? According to the dominant improper influence approach, they are unfair because some differences in educational outcomes within those systems of education are due to differences in things like social class background—things that are improper influences on differences in educational outcomes. To give all individuals a fair chance, on such an approach, would be to eliminate all such influences. In this presentation, I point to some difficulties with the improper influence approach and introduce a new approach to fairness in education: the fair chance approach. I argue that the fair chance approach provides a better explanation of what makes systems of education unfair when they are, and of what it would take to give all participants within them a fair chance.

  title: Postdictive Explanations
  abstract: | 
    In the past 20 years or so, a number of cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists—some philosophers even—have advanced so-called “postdictive” models for a variety of perceptual phenomena, including the perception of causation, colour-motion visual asynchrony, etc. Some have suggested that such postdictive mechanisms could naturally account for backward masking and beta-motion. The heralded paradigm which all these attempts invariably appeal to is Eagleman and Sejnowski’s explanation of the flash-lag effect (2000) as the first successful instance of postdiction. Yet, two things should strike us as odd in this kind of rationale for postdiction. For one thing, none of these later appeals to postidiction seem to mean what Eagleman and Sejnowski mean by that notion. Indeed, as we’ll see, there are in fact 4 notions of “postdiction”, and later uses don’t entail Eagleman and Sejnowski’s initial notion. For another, Eagleman and Sejnowski’s postdictive explanation of the flash-lag effect isn’t as successful as it is widely assumed to be.
