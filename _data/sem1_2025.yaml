  title: What is Interesting about Conspiracy Theories?
  abstract: | 
    A central debate in conspiracy theory research concerns how to conceptualize conspiracy theories in a way that advances our understanding of the phenomena and those who believe in them. This debate remains unresolved, with researchers adopting widely different positions: while some argue for a purely descriptive understanding, others seem strongly committed to the view that conspiracy theories are, or can be shown to be, inherently irrational. This paper reconstructs the controversy, arguing that it stems from two distinct scholarly motives: to attain objective knowledge of the phenomena in question versus to defend beliefs and norms that are part of the researcher’s own cultural context. By examining the epistemological and methodological challenges in this field, I highlight how competing frameworks—normative cultural biases versus objective scientific inquiry—shape our understanding of rational belief. When cultural biases influence research, they risk narrowing its scope and undermining the development of a comprehensive understanding of conspiracy theories. Ultimately, even proponents of normative cultural approaches can acknowledge that such perspectives fail to capture the full complexity and significance of these phenomena

  title: Representations, Models, and Proofs/Rules
  abstract: |
    In this paper I present and assess, firstly independently from one another, and then comparatively, the strengths and the weaknesses of three views on semantics: model-theoretic, truth-conditional, and proof-theoretic. The whole philosophical perspective from which I explore those three approaches is motivated by the investigation of the connection between truth and meaning, and also by the understanding of the role and place of meaning within a physicalist outlook of the world. I also hint at how one can combine and coordinate those three approaches depending on the philosophical issues which those systems seek to model. In the process, I present the philosophical rich and nuanced positions of Donald Davidson who pioneered the Tarski-type truth-conditional semantics for natural languages, and of Wilfrid Sellars who made an essential contribution to the understanding of both semantic and pragmatic aspects of the relations between truth and meaning from an inferentialist (proof) based perspective. The paper sketches how certain problems within the Davidsonian framework can be fixed within the Sellarsian framework. The paper ends with some critical points and challenges that I raise against the proof-theoretic (inferentialist) approach questioning its power to give a complete account of the issue of the relationship between truth, meanings, and rules.

  title: Recognizing artificial mathematical intelligence in theorem proving
  abstract: |
    One key question in the philosophy of artificial intelligence (AI) concerns how we can recognize artificial systems as intelligent. To make the general question more manageable, I focus on a particular type of AI, namely one that can prove mathematical theorems. The current generation of automated theorem provers are not understood to possess intelligence, but in my thought experiment an AI provides humanly interesting proofs of theorems and communicates them in human-like manner as scientific papers. I then ask what the criteria could be for recognizing such an AI as intelligent. I propose an approach in which the relevant criteria are based on the AI’s interaction within the mathematical community. Finally, I ask whether we can deny the intelligence of the AI in such a scenario based on reasons other than its (non-biological) material construction.

    A Dose of Medicine in Sextus Empiricus' Philosophy
  abstract: | 
    Sextus Empiricus was a doctor, a member of the Empiric school, as well as a skeptical philosopher. There are clear links between Empiricist medicine and his brand of skepticism. The use of medical analogies in Greek philosophy goes back at least to Plato. But how far does Sextus appeal to medical analogies in explaining his own philosophy? The answer is, less than we might have expected, even though he often uses examples from medicine. But perhaps he took the general analogy between skepticism and medicine for granted. It is also worth asking how far viewing his skeptical method in light of the medical analogy is helpful for us in understanding him. Here too, there may be limits to how illuminating this is; however, there are certainly connections worth exploring.
