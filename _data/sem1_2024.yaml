  title: Is lying morally wrong?
  abstract: >
    While few hold that lying is always morally wrong all things considered, many take lying to be pro tanto (or prima facie) morally wrong. This talk will explore whether the view that lying is pro tanto morally wrong can be grounded in features essential to lying. The talk will focus on two features commonly thought to be essential to lying: deceptive intent and assertoric responsibility. Taking into account recent work on the nature of lying and assertion, I will argue there are cases in which neither deceptive intent nor assertoric responsibility can ground the pro tanto moral wrongness of lying.

  title: Fictional Reality (joint work with Ben Holguín)
  abstract: This paper defends a theory of fictional truth. According to this theory, there is a fact of the matter concerning the number of hairs on Sherlock Holmes' head, and likewise for any other meaningful question one could ask about what's true in a work of fiction. We argue that a theory of this form is needed to account for the patterns in our judgments about attitude reports that embed fictional claims. We contrast our view with one of the dominant approaches to fictional truth, which originates with David Lewis. Along the way we explore the relationship between fiction, counterfactuals, and vagueness.

  title: Hume and Hájek on Miracles
  abstract: My aim here is to outline and then assess the force of Hume’s famous argument against the credibility of testimony for miracles, particularly in the light of Alan Hájek’s influential recent defence of the argument against what he describes as ‘the single most common sort of objection’ to it.  Hájek’s defence, I maintain, hinges on a confusion between prior and posterior probabilities (of which there is also a hint in Hume’s text), and once this is recognised, we can see that Hume’s “general maxim” cannot easily be revised to evade the objection.  The principle behind Hume’s argument nevertheless retains significant force against testimony for events that are acknowledged to be initially improbable (with various significant caveats regarding ‘analogical probability’ which Hájek insightfully explores).  But it is not clear that this force can legitimately be carried over – as Hume seems to assume – to the case of miracles as he defines them.  Instead, I suggest, rational rejection of miracles depends primarily on rejection of the ‘invisible agents’ that are supposed to perform them, appealing more to the considerations in the second ‘a posteriori’ part of Hume’s essay than to the ‘a priori’ first part.

  title: Epigenetics and the non-identity problem
  abstract: "The ‘non-identity problem’ has profoundly influenced the ways in which philosophers think about harm in reproductive ethics. Suppose, for example, that a woman is undergoing treatment for syphilis. If she becomes pregnant now, rather than waiting until she is cured, the child will suffer from congenital syphilis. Derek Parfit suggests that our intuition that the child is harmed if the woman fails to wait, is false. If she waits, she will have a different child: one conceived with different gametes. Parfit’s point has been taken by many commentators, to indicate a specifically genetic account of identity. But with increased understanding of epigenetics, it is not so clear that genetic identity is fixed from conception. A variety of environmental factors determine whether specific genes are silenced, or active before conception and after, and to what degree.  This process - epigenetics - calls into question the relationship between genes and identity. Accordingly, the distinction between harmful and identity-changing genetic interventions becomes difficult to sustain. In this paper, I will explore several approaches to understanding the relationship between genes, harm and identity, in ways that preserve our fundamental intuitions. Ultimately, I conclude that it is not possible to sustain both a genetic understanding of identity, and a belief that some genetic interventions are harmful (or therapeutic) and others identity-changing, whether in the conception phase or afterwards."

  title: How to theorize about social construction
  abstract: The claim that basic kinds and categories in the world are “socially constructed” is perennially debated in philosophy and social theory. Over the years, lots of categories—races, genders, sexes, morality, commodities, corporations, and many more—have been put forward as cases of social construction. But what is social construction, and how is a theory of social construction to be developed and assessed? I propose a framework for understanding the metaphysics of social entities by distinguishing questions of social construction (i.e., what socially constructs the entity to be what it is) from questions about the characteristics of the entity (i.e., what is the product of social construction). Focusing on the former, I consider families of theories of social construction and argue for the demands that a theory of social construction should meet.

  title: Limerence
  abstract: "I explore the psychologist Dorothy Tennov's (1979) largely neglected account of limerence—or, very roughly, the experience of being in love. I argue that several core features of Tennov's account are distinctive and insightful; that the concept of limerence helps us address deep confusion in our thinking about sex and love; and that reflecting on limerence may give us useful perspective on significant relationship practices like cohabitation, monogamy, and co-parenting.

  title: Verbal Disputes and Metadisputes
  abstract: "Impasses in philosophical discourse often prompt us to question the very nature of the dispute at hand. Is there a fact of the matter as to which side is right? Or does the answer simply turn on, as Carnap would put it, a choice of linguistic framework? Such questions have given rise to metadisputes, which, ironically, have become just as intractable as the first-order disputes they are about. This talk explores the possibility that these metadisputes themselves might be verbal. I propose a general framework for analyzing verbal disputes that can shed light on this possibility and argue that identifying whether a dispute is verbal ultimately hinges on one’s metasemantic views and that, in some instances, might entail there is no factual resolution to the question. I’ll consider how to theorize about such higher-order matters and explore some of the ramifications this view would have for philosophical methodology."

  title: Imagination and the paradox of fiction
  abstract: >
    When we engage with fiction, we seem to have emotions towards fictional characters.
    However, one would think that, in order to have an emotion towards someone, it is
    necessary to believe that they are real. And we do not believe that fictional characters
    are real. I argue that a solution to this puzzle can be found in a certain view about
    imaginative content. This is the view that, when one reads about a situation or an event
    involving some fictional character, and one forms a mental image as a result, what one
    imagines, strictly speaking, is that if one experienced the relevant situation or event,
    then that experience would be, for one, like having the mental image that one is
    entertaining. I motivate this view, and use it to propose a solution to the paradox of
    fiction. The proposal is that, when we engage with fiction, we do not have emotions
    towards fictional characters after all. At best, we entertain those emotions by having
    other higher-order mental states which are about them, namely, our imaginative
    episodes. The proposed solution, I argue, can explain why it feels to us as if we are
    having emotions towards fictional characters when we engage with fiction, and why,
    nevertheless, we are not disposed to behave in any particular way towards those
    characters.

  title: "The Well-Tempered Musician: On the Virtue of Obedience and the Value of Tradition" 
  abstract: "At the time Thomas Aquinas wrote the Summa Theologia, no one would have been surprised to find him arguing that obedience is a moral virtue.  They are not even likely to have been taken aback by the claim that it ‘is more praiseworthy than the other moral virtues’ (ST II-II, Q 104, A 3).  Eight centuries later, the situation is decidedly different.  Far from arguing for its pre-eminence, the average 21st century western reader is more likely to be sceptical about the claim that obedience is a virtue.  We will admit that in some domains a readiness to take orders is necessary, such as within a military command structure.  But even here we are likely to think it more a necessary evil than a kind of excellence.  The one exception might be among children, and it is a trait we expect them to grow out of. Against this backdrop, Christine Swanton’s recent call for virtue theorists to revive the virtue of obedience will come as a surprise (2021, 270-271).  Swanton recommends thinking about obedience as a role-based virtue.  This strikes us as promising.  If there is such a virtue, it makes sense to think of it as partly defined by social roles.  Our aim is to explore the contours of obedience and consider whether it can help us address a lively debate in the philosophy of music regarding the obligations of classical performers."

  title: "The Human Roots of AI"
  abstract: "In the era of intertwined human and AI-generated content, understanding their impact on cultural practices is crucial. AI-driven decision-making systems significantly influence cognition and societal well-being, yet biases towards Western perspectives risk neglecting diverse knowledge systems and cultural identities. Philosophical inquiries into AI's ontology raise profound societal implications, while viewing AI as a cultural product offers insights into its reciprocal relationship with cultural practices. This paper explores the interplay among culture, cognition, and AI to understand their implications for knowledges, cultural identities, and human narratives."

  title: "Liberalism as a Way of Life"
  abstract: "This presentation is based on my forthcoming book, Liberalism as a Way of Life, and is about how liberal values and practices can be the basis for a personal worldview, way of living, and spiritual orientation. You don’t have to be liberal and something else, such as Christian, Buddhist, Kantian, hedonist, utilitarian, or whatever else. It is fully possible and rewarding to be liberal through and through. This means that the values and attitudes enshrined in liberal political institutions, and ubiquitous in the background culture of liberal democracies – such as reciprocity, tolerance, personal freedom, impartiality, equality of opportunity, and irony – have the potential to inform a much more general sensibility, one that is supple enough to be realized in all different aspects of life: from family to the workplace, from friendship to enmity, from humour to outrage, and everything in between.

  title: "Teaching Philosophy in the Age of GenAI"
  abstract: "Generative AI (GenAI) has made teaching philosophy difficult. As the technology improves, and as other departments and faculties develop discipline appropriate adaptations, thing will get worse. One reason for this is simply that many of the solutions being proposed in other disciplines, for instance ‘authentic assessment’, work-integrated-learning, and practice-based assessments, do not easily apply to us. This difficulty demands at least two things of philosophy teachers and departments. Firstly, an awareness of philosophy’s unique position within the ‘GenAI University’. Secondly, an awareness of the challenges GenAI either creates or shines a light on.  This talk covers both of these issues and will suggest three areas that demand our attention in particular: AI grading and tutoring systems, AI and assessment, and AI and philosophical reading. This talk will explain what is at stake in each of these three areas and present, if not solutions, at least ways of appropriately articulating the problem and the kinds of solutions available."
  notes: "Thomas Corbin is a Research Fellow in the Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning (CRADLE) at Deakin University. His main focus is on Generative AI, particularly with a view to assessment. Dr Corbin leads a multi-institution research team working on the project "Teaching the Humanities in the Age of GenAI," which explores the challenges and opportunities presented by GenAI in humanities education, particularly within philosophy units operating in Australian Universities. Gene Flenady is a lecturer in philosophy at Monash University. His research concerns the structure and social conditions of human rational agency, mobilising the resources of the German idealist tradition to normatively assess the implications of new technologies for meaningful work and tertiary pedagogy."

  title: "Justice in Gestation and Moral Integrity: A Dilemma"
  abstract: "Political philosophers have recently turned to the topic of justice in gestation, emphasising that the uterine environment contributes to future health outcomes and talents enjoyed in adulthood. In this presentation, I argue that bringing justice to bear on gestation is more difficult than it may seem at first glance. The fact that there are no unmediated channels between foetuses and the state makes foetuses among the least accessible subjects of justice. It also means that for the state to protect the interests of foetuses, it must command full compliance on the part of pregnant women, which comes at a very high cost to this group. I show that even the most plausible principle of justice in gestation leads to the state demanding the unthinkable from some of its citizens. I conclude the discussion by defending a solution that allows the state to realise justice for biological parents and their foetuses."
