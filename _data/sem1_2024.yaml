  title: Is lying morally wrong?
  abstract: >
    While few hold that lying is always morally wrong all things considered, many take lying to be pro tanto (or prima facie) morally wrong. This talk will explore whether the view that lying is pro tanto morally wrong can be grounded in features essential to lying. The talk will focus on two features commonly thought to be essential to lying: deceptive intent and assertoric responsibility. Taking into account recent work on the nature of lying and assertion, I will argue there are cases in which neither deceptive intent nor assertoric responsibility can ground the pro tanto moral wrongness of lying.

  title: Fictional Reality (joint work with Ben Holguín)
  abstract: This paper defends a theory of fictional truth. According to this theory, there is a fact of the matter concerning the number of hairs on Sherlock Holmes' head, and likewise for any other meaningful question one could ask about what's true in a work of fiction. We argue that a theory of this form is needed to account for the patterns in our judgments about attitude reports that embed fictional claims. We contrast our view with one of the dominant approaches to fictional truth, which originates with David Lewis. Along the way we explore the relationship between fiction, counterfactuals, and vagueness.

  title: Hume and Hájek on Miracles
  abstract: My aim here is to outline and then assess the force of Hume’s famous argument against the credibility of testimony for miracles, particularly in the light of Alan Hájek’s influential recent defence of the argument against what he describes as ‘the single most common sort of objection’ to it.  Hájek’s defence, I maintain, hinges on a confusion between prior and posterior probabilities (of which there is also a hint in Hume’s text), and once this is recognised, we can see that Hume’s “general maxim” cannot easily be revised to evade the objection.  The principle behind Hume’s argument nevertheless retains significant force against testimony for events that are acknowledged to be initially improbable (with various significant caveats regarding ‘analogical probability’ which Hájek insightfully explores).  But it is not clear that this force can legitimately be carried over – as Hume seems to assume – to the case of miracles as he defines them.  Instead, I suggest, rational rejection of miracles depends primarily on rejection of the ‘invisible agents’ that are supposed to perform them, appealing more to the considerations in the second ‘a posteriori’ part of Hume’s essay than to the ‘a priori’ first part.

  title: Imagination and the paradox of fiction
  abstract: >
    When we engage with fiction, we seem to have emotions towards fictional characters.
    However, one would think that, in order to have an emotion towards someone, it is
    necessary to believe that they are real. And we do not believe that fictional characters
    are real. I argue that a solution to this puzzle can be found in a certain view about
    imaginative content. This is the view that, when one reads about a situation or an event
    involving some fictional character, and one forms a mental image as a result, what one
    imagines, strictly speaking, is that if one experienced the relevant situation or event,
    then that experience would be, for one, like having the mental image that one is
    entertaining. I motivate this view, and use it to propose a solution to the paradox of
    fiction. The proposal is that, when we engage with fiction, we do not have emotions
    towards fictional characters after all. At best, we entertain those emotions by having
    other higher-order mental states which are about them, namely, our imaginative
    episodes. The proposed solution, I argue, can explain why it feels to us as if we are
    having emotions towards fictional characters when we engage with fiction, and why,
    nevertheless, we are not disposed to behave in any particular way towards those
    characters.
