The Philosophy Seminar Room and my office in the Quadrangle. The Quadrangle is visible from almost everywhere on campus. Just look for the clock tower.

To get to the Philosophy Seminar Room (N494) you can either enter via the entrance on the left as you face the clock tower, go up the stairs, turn right, and then go all the way along the main corridor until you see room N494 on you right. Alternatively, you can enter via the entrance on the right, go up the stairs, and turn left, proceed a little while until you see room N494 on your left.

To get to the Philosophy Common Room, enter via the entrance on the left as you face the clock tower, go up the stairs, turn right after going up the stairs. The Philosophy Common Room is the first door on the left.
