### Subscribe to Calendar 

You can subscribe to the University of Sydney Philosophy Seminar Series Calendar here using the following link: 

> [http://www.sydphil.wiki/cal.ics](http://www.sydphil.wiki/cal.ics) 

Use this address to subscribe to the calendar in your calendar program. (Make sure you subscribe instead of importing the calendar so you get updates). 

If you are using the Calendar app on a Mac then this is straightforward. With
the app open go File > New Calendar Subscription. Use the link above.
I recommend having the Calendar update every day so that you don't miss
updates. 

If you are using Outlook then things are slightly more complicated. As far as
I can tell, the easiest way to subscribe is to sign in online, go to your
calendar, find the "Add calendar" option under the small calendar. Then
"Subscribe from web" with the link above.
